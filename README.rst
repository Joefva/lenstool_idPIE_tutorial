Read the Docs: lenstool
=========================

* Read the tutorial here:
https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/


* Compile html (may also do latex or xml): 
sphinx-build -b html docs/sphinx/source docs/sphinx/build/html

* For the "API", one can refer to the full code of Lenstool, if this is in this directory.
Or cf. 'Sphinx-CPP-TriangleLib-1.1', as an instance, and work from there. 
And see: https://leimao.github.io/blog/CPP-Documentation-Using-Sphinx/ for the API in C/C++.
