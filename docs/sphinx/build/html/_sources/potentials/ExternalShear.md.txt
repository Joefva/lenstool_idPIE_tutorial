# ExternalShear

Set the potential profile to the type external shear and convergence. 

This potential takes 3 parameters:

- `gamma`, the strength $\gamma$ of the external shear, constant over the field of view
- `angle_pos` [in degrees], the angle of the shear direction against horizontal
- `kappa`, the strength of the external convergence, constant over the field of view
