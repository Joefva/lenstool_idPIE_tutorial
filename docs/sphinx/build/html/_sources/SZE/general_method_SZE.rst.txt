Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect extension: Basics
============================================

Since the work of `Beauchesne et al. 2023 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230110907B/abstract>`_
, Lenstool is able to use X-ray data to model the intra-cluster gas (see :doc:`../X-ray/X-ray`). 
In a similar fashion, we can use the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, observed in submillimetre frequencies, to constrain the properties of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). 
This SZ effect (SZE) is can be added to the ``lenstool`` parameter file by adding one section, and selecting the SZE-bright potential with keyword ``SZE``.


.. _theoreticalpreliminary:

Theoretical preliminary
-----------------------

The CMB photons are permanently bathing the Universe. As a result, they can occasionally interact with physical objects at an observable scale.
The thermal, non-relativistic, hot electrons of the ICM create the condition for an inverse Compton scattering: in a spectral band-width of CMB photons, one can observe the broadening of the band due to the Doppler effect.
Therefore, `cold` or `hot` spots in CMB surveys such as *Planck* or ACT (Atacama Cosmology Telescope) may reveal the presence of the ICM associated with galaxy clusters.
This effect was first described in `Sunyaev and Zel’dovich 1970a <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00653471>`_, `b <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00653472>`_.

Given a CMB temperature 
:math:`T_r \simeq 2.726` K today, we introduce the reduced frequency is defined as:

.. math::

    x = \frac{h \nu}{k_B T_r},

where 
:math:`k_B` is the Boltzmann constant, 
:math:`h` is the Planck constant and 
:math:`\nu` is the measured frequency.
We also introduce the Compton parameter
:math:`y`:

.. math::

    y = \frac{k_B \sigma_T}{m_e c^2} \int n_e T_e \mathrm{d}l,

where 
:math:`m_e` the electron mass, 
:math:`c` the celerity of light, 
:math:`\sigma_T` the Thomson cross-section, 
:math:`n_e` the ICM electron number density, 
:math:`T_e` the ICM electron temperature and 
:math:`\int \mathrm{d}l` the integral over the line-of-sight. 

We can also define the electron optical depth 
:math:`\tau_e`:

.. math::

    \tau_e = \int \sigma_T n_e \mathrm{d}l.


We can now write the SZE temperature contrast:

.. math::

   \Theta_r = \frac{\Delta T}{T_r} = \frac{(e^x - 1)^2}{x^4 e^x} \frac{\Delta I}{I_0} = \left[ x \coth \left( \frac{x}{2} \right) - 4 \right] y,

where 
:math:`\Delta T = T - T_r` is the SZE spectral temperature contrast, 
:math:`\Delta I` is the SZE spectral intensity shift and
:math:`I_0` the spectral intensity of the CMB.

.. note::

   WARNING: Please notice that this only describes the thermal SZ effect (tSZE). The kinematic and polarisation SZE are a priori much fainter, but may create offsets in the data. 
   



.. _howitworks:

How it works
---------------

This extension to ``lenstool`` computes a map of 
:math:`y` for a potential, which allows to constraint the shape of the gas haloes with the SZE data maps, and to produce the related quantities as map. 
For now, only the dPIE and idPIE 
:math:`n_e` potentials are implemented.
A temperature 
:math:`T_e` map can be given as an input, or we can use different polytropic temperatue laws (detailed in the :ref:`temperature_profiles` section).



.. _density_profiles:

Density profiles
------------------

.. _dPIE_profile_SZE:

dPIE Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ICM corresponding to the dPIE profile (see :doc:`../Supported_pot`) for the SZE simply describes the gas density as a dPIE, independant of any other parameter. Therefore, it uses the same description as other dPIE potentials.

.. _idPIE_profile_SZE:

idPIE Profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See section :doc:`../X-ray/usage`.


.. _temperature_profiles:

Temperature profiles
---------------------

See section :doc:`../ICM_Te_models`.

.. _example_potential:

Example of ``Potential``
-------------------------

The ``potential`` keyword presents two additional parameters: ``SZE`` and ``Gas_fraction``.

- ``SZE``, ``bool``: 1 if dPIE SZE-bright, 2 for idPIE SZE-bright, 0 otherwise. Default: 0.
- ``Gas_fraction``, ``float``: Fraction of gas (multiplying the density, between 0 and 1). Default: 1.

.. code-block:: console

		end



.. _SZE_optimisation_block:

SZE optimisation parameters
----------------------------

This SZE extension adds a ``lenstool`` keyword to the parameter file, to input the specific parameters.
Three maps must be provided, in order to compute the observed Compton parameter 
:math:`y`:

- Contrast Temperature map ``SZE_map`` in the submillimetre spectrum, measuring the SZE effect.
- Standard deviation of the measured contrast Temperature map ``std_map``.
- Temperature map ``Temperature_map`` of the ICM of the cluster. This is the temperature of the cluster, not of the scattered CMB photons. This map can be replaced by an analytical temperature model (see ``Temp0`` and ``Jz_array``).


We give an example of the ``SZE`` section:

.. code-block:: console

	SZE
		pixel_area      0.00833333
		Optimisation    1
		Optimisation_z  0.4
		Temp0           13.4                            # keV
		Jz_array        1 polyE Jz_polyE_z0.4000.csv    # 'polyE' is the default.
		Gauss_stat_norm     252.2                       # = N_PIX_SZ/N_IM_SL  (for instance)
		psf             3 ACT_PSFmap.fits
		frequency       150.                            # GHz

		model_type      0
		end

..		Type_factor_likelihood   1

where:

- ``frequency``, ``float``: frequency of measurement the SZE map, in :math:`\mathrm{GHz}`. Default: 0. Note: several frequencies (from a same telescope) can be input together as ``{float1,float2}``.

- ``SZE_map``, ``int``: 1 if the map is in Compton parameter :math:`y`, 2 for a CMB temperature contrast in :math:`\mathrm{K}`, 3 for a CMB temperature in :math:`\mu \mathrm{K}`, 0 to switch off. Default: 0. ``string``: Path of the temperature contrast map. Note: several maps (from a same telescope, with the same ``int`` unit) can be input together as ``{string1,string2}``.

.. note::

	TO DO: multiple maps with a same command.
	
- ``Std_map``, ``int``: 1 if the map is in Compton parameter :math:`y`, 2 for a CMB temperature contrast in :math:`\mathrm{K}`, 3 for a CMB temperature in :math:`\mu \mathrm{K}`, 6 for a map in inverse variance in :math:`\mu \mathrm{K}^{-2}`, 0 to switch off. Default: 0. ``string``: Path of the measured standard deviation of the temperature contrast. Note: several maps (from a same telescope, with the same ``int`` unit) can be input together as ``{string1,string2}``.

- ``Temperature_map``, ``int``: 1 if the ICM temperature map is in :math:`\mathrm{K}`, 2 if the map is in :math:`\mathrm{keV}`, 0 to switch off. Default: 0. ``string``: Path of the measured ICM electron temperature map :math:`T_e`. If ``int`` is not 0, this overrides any analytical temperature model.

- ``pixel_area``, ``float``: pixel size for all maps (must be identical), in :math:`\mathrm{deg}`. Default: 1.

- ``Optimisation``, ``bool``: 1 or 0 to activate/deactivate the SZE optimisation, through likelihood optimisation. Default: 0.

- ``Optimisation_z``, ``float``: redshift of the ICM. Default: 0.

- ``Temp0``, ``float``: pivot temperature in :math:`\mathrm{keV}`, in case of an analytical ICM temperature model. Default: 0. For more details, see :ref:`temperature_profiles`.

- ``Jz_array``, ``bool``: 1 or 0 to compute/not compute the :math:`\mathcal{J}_z` array, necessary to use a hydrostatic ``idPIE`` :math:`n_e` ICM density profile (see :ref:`idPIE_profile_SZE`). Default: 0. ``string``: temperature model (see :ref:`temperature_profiles`). Default: ``polyE``. ``string``: name of the output array. If the array is not computed (``0``), this array must already exist, if the user is using idPIE profiles (keyword ``SZE 2``, in combination with ``profile 81`` in :ref:`example_potential`).

- ``Gauss_stat_norm``, ``float``: Normalisation of the log-likelihood of the SZE. For instance, setting this parameter to 10 multiplies the SZE Gaussian log-likelihood by a factor 1/10. Default: 1.

.. - ``Type_factor_likelihood``: ``int``: Not used yet, this should be used if other types of likelihood are to be implemented for SZE. Default: 1 (Gaussian).

- ``psf``, TO DO

- ``beam``, ``bool``: 1 if there is a dispersion beam to take into account in the maps, 0 otherwise. Default: 0. ``string``: filename of the beam.

- ``model_type``, ``int``: 0 for a simple Gaussian model, where the model std is considered to be 0. 1 for a model std equal to the model SZE value itself. Default: 0. (TO DO.)


.. _SZE_Optimisation:

SZE Optimisation
-----------------

The optimisation is performed through a Monte Carlo method, with the Markov Chains Monte Carlo engine `bayeSys <(https://www.inference.org.uk/bayesys/>`_ implemented in the ``Lenstool`` C code or through any optimiser with the Python wrapper of the ``Lenstool`` C library. The Gaussian log-likelihood writes:

.. math::

   \ln \mathcal{L}_{\rm Gauss} = - \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i} \left[ \ln \sigma_i^2 + \ln 2 \pi + \left(\frac{M_i -  C_i}{\sigma_i} \right)^2 \right],
	
where: 

- :math:`M_i` is the model value in the :math:`i`-th pixel, 
- :math:`C_i` is the detected value in the :math:`i`-th pixel (provided through ``SZE_map``) and 
- :math:`\sigma_i` is the standard deviation in the :math:`i`-th pixel. If ``model_type = 0``, it is simply the value :math:`\sigma_{C, i}` provided through ``Std_map``. If ``model_type = 1``, then :math:`\sigma_i^2 = \sigma_{C, i}^2 + M_i^2`.

.. _Python_optimisation_SZE:

SZE Python optimisation
------------------------

.. note::

	TO DO



.. _Xray_compatibility:

X-ray compatibility
--------------------

As the ICM observed through X-ray and SZE is the same baryonic medium, the parameters used to describe both should be identical (Temparature model, density profile, etc.).



.. note::
	
	TO DO: TO COMPLETE. The following is just the X-ray template to adapt.



At the end of the optimisation or at the production of a `chires.dat` file, the code will generate the three following maps:
- `Xray_model_counts.fits`: Maps that has the same size has the imput maps and contains in each pixel the value of the best-fit count model.
- `Xray_residual_counts.fits` : Same as before, but with the residual (i.e. Data-model)
- `Xray_loglikelihood_pix.fits` : Same as before, but each pixel contains the value of the loglikelihood associated.

These allows you to see the best-fit count model and see which part of the field are badly/betterly reproduced. These map can be created for other models than the best as long as you have a parameter file for them by using the usual lenstool method to produce map, which is by specifying them in the `runmode` section with the following lines:
- `X-ray 2 0 z_lens Xray_model_counts.fits`
- `X-ray 3 0 z_lens Xray_residual_counts.fits` 
- `X-ray 4 0 z_lens Xray_loglikelihood_pix.fits`

These lines have to be used one by one, as lenstool does not have the hability to create multiple maps of the same keywords at the same time. Here, the size of the maps are defined by the input maps, so the integer related to the number of pixel per row and column is `0`.

In addition, other quantity related to the best-fit model can be found in the `chires.dat`  that contains will contains the usual lines associated with the other likelihood defined such as the lensing one. Here is an example of the X-ray lines:

```
chi X-ray surface brightness
N_pixel    16900
Cash_Statistic    -437152.56002
Cstat    4661.77537
log(likelihood)    -33189.73608
Monte Carlo estimation of the quality of the fit: Mean: -32915.46507 Std: 87.35700
Interval 1 sigma: min -> -33002.06100 ||max -> -32829.06987 
Interval 3 sigma: min -> -33177.52215 ||max -> -32648.07052 
Interval 5 sigma: min -> -33255.71946 ||max -> -32599.59211
```


Where `N_pixel` contains the total number of pixel, the  `Cash_Statistic` is equal to $-2\times\log\left(\mathcal{L}\right)$ (Correct definition if $\sigma_{X}=0$). The `Cstat` is defined as follows:
$\text{Cstat}=\sum^{\rm N_{pixel} }_{\rm i} 2(M_i-D_i+D_i\log\left(\frac{D_i}{M_i}\right))$
It is similar to the one implemented in Xspec or Sherpa. In case $M_i=0$, we replace the previous term in the sum by $2 D_i$. We added these two other likelihoods to provide a comparison with other X-ray fitting software. These lines also contains the results of the goodness of fit procedure presented in [Beauchesne+23](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023arXiv230110907B/abstract). The idea of this procedure is to see if the observed data are likely to be produced by the count model, ideally we would build such distribution by using the full posterior however for computing time reason we only use the best-fit model. Hence, we are sampling in each pixels $100000$ realisation of the associated distribution which is a Poisson distribution or the Poisson-Gamma mixture. The number of counts in the pixel is the mean of the Poisson distribution for the earlier when it is the mean of the Gamma distribution in the latter. This distribution have $\sigma_{X}$ as standard deviation and the random variate defined is then the mean of the Poisson distribution of the mixture. We then compute the likelihood associated with each of the sample and extract the following information:
```
Monte Carlo estimation of the quality of the fit: Mean: Sample mean Std: Sample standard deviation
Interval 1 sigma: min -> percentile 16% ||max -> percentile 84% 
Interval 3 sigma: min -> percentile .135% ||max -> percentile 99.865% 
Interval 5 sigma: min -> percentile .0000286% ||max -> percentile 99.9999713%
```

From this information, you can see how likely the model will produce the observed data and set up a threshold for your own analysis and see how much you should complexify your model. To make an analogy with a gaussian likelihood, this criteria is computing an equivalent to the $\chi^2\sim1$ which does not exist for Poisson-like likelihood. Indeed,  the value would be changing for each different case.


## Data product implemented

For now, there are not much maps that can be produced by more will come as the extension is used. To create a map, here is the syntax to add in the `runmode`:
```
runmode
    X-ray type N_pix z name_file
    end
```
`type` (integer) is the type of map that you can produce, `N_pix` the number of pixel per column and row, `z` the redshift for which you would like to compute the map (that plane need to have some X-ray potential to not return only $0$) and finally the name of the fits file you want to create. Here are the type of map you can do:
-	$0$: Do nothing
-	$1$: Map of the mass model ($\int \rho_{gas}^2$) times the map provided through the `Emissivity_map` keyword in the `X-ray` section. If the cooling function is provided, you will obtain the surface brightness. It can be used to create a count map by providing the `count_factor_map` in the previous keyword, the difference with `type` $2$ is that the map is interpolated to be computed at the defined resolution with a bilinear interpolation. 
-	$2$: Count model with the same size as the input data map
-	$3$: residual map with the same size as the input data map
-	$4$: Loglikelihood map with the same size as the input data map

Type of maps to be implemented in the future:
-	Map of the projected gas mass
-	Map of the projected gas fraction
-	...

If the type of map that you would like to see is not implemented, you can contact us to see if we can put that in place.
