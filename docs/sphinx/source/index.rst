Welcome to the Lenstool documentation!
=======================================

**Lenstool** is a gravitational lensing software for modelling mass distribution of galaxies and clusters (strong and weak regime).

Further information may be found in the `Lenstool WikiStart <https://projets.lam.fr/projects/lenstool/wiki>`_.

.. note::

   For the moment, this tutorial is only focusing on the introduction of ``idPIE`` potentials to perform the joint X-ray and lensing optimisation model of the density of dark matter and intra-cluster medium.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information on ``idPIE`` profiles, and :doc:`tutorial` for a short tutorial on their usage in ``lenstool``.

.. how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   This project is under active development. It is compatible with v8 of ``lenstool``.
